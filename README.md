# The-Kingdom-s-Railway-Network-A-Puzzle-Game-Development-Overview

The Kingdom's Railway Network is an engaging puzzle game where players construct a circular railway track across the realm of Seeknotland, ensuring that all traversable areas are connected. The game is played on a square grid (5x5 for Easy mode and 7x7 for Hard mode), featuring different terrain types such as empty land, bridges, mountains, and oases, each imposing specific placement rules. Players must strategically place railway tracks to form a continuous loop without crossing paths or leaving necessary areas untouched. The game includes a dynamic menu where players can enter their name, choose the difficulty level, and access game rules. The gameplay screen displays a randomly selected map based on difficulty, a timer, and a leaderboard tracking the fastest completions. Players can place tracks through various methods, including clicking, dragging, and rotating tiles. The game concludes when a valid railway loop is formed, displaying the completion time and updating the leaderboard. Advanced features include saving game progress and storing leaderboards using LocalStorage. Developed using a single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript and CSS, the game ensures an intuitive and interactive experience while adhering to best coding practices.
